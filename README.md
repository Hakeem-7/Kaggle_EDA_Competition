# Kaggle_EDA_Competition

As discussed in the first zoom meeting held earlier today, kindly endeavor to peruse others code while keeping the big picture in mind - telling a story with data.
You can hit the ground running by contributing to the repository. Please be kind enough to not write in esoteric ways. Adding comments to each module makes
collaboration easier and fun.
